# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Overview:
---

We have been tasked with creating an interactive dashboard that displays bacterial data living in a human's belly button collected from volunteer samples. By using Plotly.JS and HTML/CSS we were able to visualize in the dashboard each volunteers; demographic information, top 10 bacteria found, the frenquency with which they wash their belly button, and the bacteria cultures per sample. Through a drop-down menu a user can select any of the volunteers listed to see their bacterial data visualized.
